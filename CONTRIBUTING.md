# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few simple guidelines:

- File issues for bugs or feature requests and include reproducible steps.
- For code changes, open a pull request against `main` with a short description and tests where appropriate.
- Keep changes small and focused. Add tests for new behavior when possible.
- Be respectful and constructive in code review discussions.

If you're unsure where to start, open an issue and we can discuss it.
